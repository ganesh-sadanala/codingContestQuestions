2.Any number can be expressed as the difference of squares of two numbers
ex: x=p^2-q^2 except the number whose remainder is 2 when divided by 4.

4. a=x&y, b=x|y maintains the number of set bits

5. from 0 to 10^9 , sum of the digits lies in the range of
1 to 81.

6. (a|b)-b is same as a&(~b), ~ is an operator in programming
   ! is different from ~.

7. Catalan Number(Source: GfG):
   -> Count total ways of n matching parenthesis. -> c(n/2)
   -> Number of possible Binary search trees with n keys or number of unlabeled trees -> catalan number
   -> Number of possible binary trees with n keys or number of labeled trees-> catalan number * n!.
   -> Number of full binary trees -> My article C(n-1/2)
   -> Number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2*n such that no two chords intersect.
   -> Number of ways a convex polygon of n+2 sides can split into triangles by connecting vertices. -> catalan(n)
   -> Number of different unlabeled binary trees.
   -> Number of paths with 2n steps from bottom left to top right in a rectangular grid
      that do not cross over the main diagonal.
   -> Number of ways to insert n pairs of parentheses in a word of n+1 letters,
      e.g., for n=2 there are 2 ways: ((ab)c) or (a(bc)). For n=3 there are 5 ways, ((ab)(cd)), (((ab)c)d), ((a(bc))d), (a((bc)d)), (a(b(cd))).
